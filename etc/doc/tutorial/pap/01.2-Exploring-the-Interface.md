## A. Play Controls

E botón rosnan aki ta e kontrolnan prinsipal pa start i stop zonido.
Tin e botón *Run* pa run e kódigo den e editor, *Stop* pa stop tur kódigo

*Size -* ta lagabo hasi e teksto mas grandi of mas chikitu.
E botón *Align* ta hasi bo kódigo mas duidelijk i mustra mas profeshonal.

## C. Info and Help

These blue buttons give you access to information, help and
preferences. The *Info* button will open up the information window which
contains information about Sonic Pi itself - the core team, history,
contributors and community. The *Help* button toggles the help system
(*G*) and the *Prefs* button toggles the preferences window which allows
you to control some basic system parameters.

## D. Code Editor

This is the area where you'll write your code and compose/perform
music. It's a simple text editor where you can write code, delete it,
cut and paste, etc. Think of it like a very basic version of Word or
Google Docs. The editor will automatically colour words based on their
meaning in the code. This may seem strange at first, but you'll soon
find it very useful. For example, you'll know something is a number
because it is blue.

## E. Prefs Panel

Sonic Pi supports a number of tweakable preferences which can be
accessed by toggling the *prefs* button in the Info and Help button
set. This will toggle the visibility of the Prefs Panel which includes a
number of options to be changed. Examples are forcing mono mode,
inverting stereo, Toggling log output verbosity and also a volume slider
and audio selector on the Raspberry Pi.

## F. Log Viewer

When you run your code, information about what the program is doing will
be displayed in the log viewer. By default, you'll see a message for
every sound you create with the exact time the sound was triggered. This
is very useful for debugging your code and understanding what your code
is doing.

## G. Help System

Finally, one of the most important parts of the Sonic Pi interface is
the help system which appears at the bottom of the window. This can be
toggled on and off by clicking on the blue *Help* button. The help
system contains help and information about all aspects of Sonic Pi
including this tutorial, a list of available synths, samples, examples,
FX and a full list of all the functions Sonic Pi provides for coding
music.
